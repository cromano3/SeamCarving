<h2>Binary heap</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>Earth is home to thousands of species of trees: tall trees, deciduous trees, Christmas trees. Similarly, there is a large variety of trees in computer science as well. In this topic, we are going to learn about an important data structure that plays a vast role in several algorithms —<strong> binary heap</strong>. This type of tree will be the key to building one of the most efficient sorting algorithms, and we will also use it to implement several other data structures. So, let's get started.</p><h5 id="formal-definition">Formal definition</h5><p>A <strong>binary heap</strong> is a binary tree with the following properties:</p><ul><li><p>it is a<strong> </strong>complete binary tree;</p></li><li><p>each node's value is the maximum (minimum) among all values present in its subtrees.</p></li></ul><p>Let's recall that a <strong>complete</strong> binary tree has the following properties:</p><ul><li><p>all levels, except possibly the last one, are fully filled;</p></li><li><p>if the last level is not complete, the nodes are filled from left to right. </p></li></ul><p>As an attentive reader, you have noticed the word "minimum" in parentheses in the definition above. Let's clarify it. Binary heaps can be of two types: <strong>max-heaps</strong> and <strong>min-heaps</strong>. Naturally, a binary heap is a max-heap if each node's value is the maximum among all values present in its subtrees. In the opposite case, we call it a min-heap. The images below show various examples of binary heaps:</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="max-heap and min-heap" height="280" src="https://ucarecdn.com/1c4e5dd7-46b4-42f0-b4f7-062c1dfba189/" width="832"/></p><p>Let's call <span class="math-tex">\(T\)</span> the last max-heap above. We will perform some interesting operations on it later in the topic.</p><p>Just like with some other trees, the elements of a binary heap can be of any data type for which the comparison operator is defined (integers, characters, strings, etc.). There exist numerous operations that we can perform on binary heaps; however, in this topic we will cover only some of them — in particular, those that we will need in the following topics on the subject.</p><p> </p><p></p><div class="alert alert-primary"><p>Despite the fact that later in this topic we will talk about max-heaps, min-heaps work absolutely the same. The only difference is the comparison characters that we will use when constructing a heap and performing operations with it.</p></div><p></p><p> </p><h5 id="inserting-an-element">Inserting an element</h5><p>The features of the operation of inserting an element are dictated by the basic properties of a binary heap that we have listed at the beginning of this topic. Because of the completeness property, the only possible place to insert a new node is after the last node at the last level. If the last level is filled, then we put the node as the first one at the next level. However, this simple action may still break the maximum property. Formally, the steps of insertion are described below:</p><ol><li><p>Add the new element at the end of the heap as described above.</p></li><li><p>Compare the added element with its parent: if its value is not greater than the value in the parent node, terminate.</p></li><li><p>Otherwise, swap them and return to step <span class="math-tex">\(2\)</span>. Note that our element will now have a new parent after the swapping.</p></li></ol><p>The time complexity of this operation is <span class="math-tex">\(O(\log n)\)</span>, where <span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span> is the number of the nodes in our tree. Indeed, the number of swappings performed is not greater than the height of the tree, namely <span class="math-tex">\(\log n\)</span>: each time we swap elements, we move one level above, and in the worst case we might need to reach the root. </p><p>Let's illustrate the steps of this operation with a simple example. The following images demonstrate the process of adding the item <span class="math-tex">\(12\)</span> to the tree <span class="math-tex">\(T\)</span>:</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Steps  of the Insert Element operation on Binary heap" height="352" src="https://ucarecdn.com/fc5164ee-e885-4523-a103-0440d6651f54/" width="1017"/></p><h5 id="pseudocode-for-insert-max-heap">Pseudocode for insert (max-heap):</h5><p>The data structure for a tree is an array T, where the first element, T[1], is the element at the root, and the descendants of the element T[i] are T[2*i] and T[2*i+1] (but only when numbering elements of an array starting with 1).</p><pre><code class="java">function insert(T, k):
    T.append(k)                                                   // adding a new element to the end
    index_now = len(T)                                            // calculating the index of the added element
    index_prev = index_now // 2                                   // calculating the index of the previous node (divide by 2 and round to the smallest)
    while index_now &gt; 1 and T[index_prev] &lt; T[index_now]:         // the loop will continue until the current element is at the root (its index is equal to 1) and until the value in the node is less than the current one
        T[index_prev] = T[index_now]                              // swapping the current value and the value in the node
        T[index_now] = T[index_prev] 
        index_now = index_prev                                    // changing the index of the current element (now it is equal to the node)
        index_prev = index_now // 2                               // recalculating the index of the new previous node</code></pre><h5 id="extracting-the-maximum-with-heapify">Extracting the maximum with heapify</h5><p>The largest element in the max-heap is always the root of the tree, which means that to extract the maximum, we basically need to learn to remove the <strong>root</strong> element. However, deletion might cause trouble with the maximum property. Hence, we need to first define another crucial operation: <strong>heapify</strong>. It is an operation performed on a single node, moving it down the tree until the order is correct. In formal words, it works in the following way:</p><ol><li><p>Compare the given node with its children: if our element is not smaller than the value of each of its children, we finish.</p></li><li><p>Otherwise, choose the child with the largest value. Swap it with our element. Repeat step <span class="math-tex">\(1\)</span>. Note that now our element is one level below, so its subtree will be smaller.</p></li></ol><p>Now we can easily describe the <strong>extract_max </strong>operation:</p><ol><li><p>Remove the root element. You might want to save its value in a variable or array for further operations.</p></li><li><p>Select the rightmost element from the lowest level (the leaves) and move it to the root.</p></li><li><p>Perform heapify on the new root.</p></li></ol><p>Note that these operations are very similar to insertion. The only difference is that when the maximum property is broken, we move the elements down and not up. However, it is clear that the time taken is the same. Therefore, the time complexity for heapify is <span class="math-tex">\(O(\log n)\)</span>. Extract_max has the same time complexity, as it performs heapify once and a couple of basic operations that take <span class="math-tex">\(O(1)\)</span>.</p><p>Here is how the operation to extract maximum is performed step by step on our heap <span class="math-tex">\(T\)</span>:</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Operation to extract maximum  on Binary heap" height="641" src="https://ucarecdn.com/e6e63f0e-7fb2-4ae3-90f1-74fa0458a5b0/" width="782"/></p><p>There are other operations that we can perform on binary heaps, such as removal and alteration of any value in the binary heap. Using these operations will require changing the data structure a bit. We will talk about it during practice. In the meantime, you can check some <a href="https://visualgo.net/en/heap" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">visualizations of the operations</a> mentioned above.</p><h5 id="pseudocode-for-extract_max">Pseudocode for extract_max:</h5><pre><code class="java">function extract_max(T):
    result = T[1]    // memorizing the root value
    T[1] = T.pop()   // writing the last value to the root (and deleting the root at the same time)

By definition, a binary heap is a complete binary tree with the following property: the value of each node is not smaller than the value of its children in the case of max-heaps, and not greater in the case of min-heaps. The most common operations on binary heaps are:</p><ul><li><p><code class="java">insert(T, k)</code> — inserting a new element <span class="math-tex">\(k\)</span> in <span class="math-tex">\(O(\log n)\)</span> time;</p></li><li><p><code class="java">heapify(T, k)</code> — moving the element <span class="math-tex">\(k\)</span> down the tree until it satisfies the maximum property; it takes <span class="math-tex">\(O(\log n)\)</span> time;</p></li><li><p><code class="java">extract_max(T)</code> — extracting the largest element; its time complexity is also <span class="math-tex">\(O(\log n)\)</span>.</p></li></ul><p>All in all, a binary heap is a useful data structure with several important applications, as we shall soon see in some of the following topics.</p>
